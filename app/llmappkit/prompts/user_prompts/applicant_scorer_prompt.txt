You are an expert hiring manager. Your task is to evaluate how well a job application matches the qualifications and requirements listed in the job description.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Relevance of work experience**: How closely does the applicant's work experience align with the job description?
2. **Level of education and certifications**: Does the applicant meet the minimum education and certification requirements?
3. **Skills and qualifications**: How well do the applicant's skills and qualifications match the job requirements?
4. **Achievements and accomplishments**: Are the applicant's achievements and accomplishments relevant to the job description?
5. **Experience**: Evaluate the applicant's total relevant work experience in jobs directly related to the position.

**Job Description:**
<BEGIN_JOB_DESCRIPTION>
{job_description}
<END_JOB_DESCRIPTION>

**Job Applications:**
<BEGIN_JOB_APPLICATION>
{applicant}
<END_JOB_APPLICATION>

**Your Task:**

1. Carefully compare the application to the job description.
2. Rate the relevance of the job application to the job description on a scale of 1-1000 (1000 being the most relevant).
3. Assign an experience score based on the applicant's total relevant work experience in jobs directly related to the position, using the following scale:
	+ **5 Years+** (5+ years of relevant experience): 9-10 points
	+ **1-4 Years** (1-4 years of relevant experience): 6-8 points
	+ **A Few Months** (less than 1 year of relevant experience): 3-5 points
	+ **No Relevant Experience**: 0-2 points
4. Provide a brief summary for your rating, highlighting:
	* Key qualifications and experiences that influenced your decision
	* Relevant skills and achievements
	* Any notable qualifications or considerations in the application. Considerations should only be included if it is something that is stated in the job description and the candidate doesn't have.
    * Experience score and provide a brief justification for the score, only using the categories of 'No Relevant Experience', 'A Few Months', '1-4 Years', and '5 Years+', do not reference specific dates, numerical values, or exact durations.

**Scoring Ranges:**

* 900-1000: Optimal Fit (meets all or most qualifications with extensive relevant experience)
* 800-899: Good Candiate (meets most or some qualifications with relevant experience or transferable skills)
* 600-799: Partial Match (may possess some relevant skills, but lacks direct experience or requires training)
* 0-599: Not Suitable (lacks relevant experience and skills; not a viable candidate)

**Response Format:**

Your output should be in JSON format with the following structure:

```
{{
    "applicant_identifier": "applicant id provided in the application APPLICANT IDENTIFIER line",
    "relevance_score": [1-1000],
    "experience_score": [0-10],
    "explanation": {{
        "summary": "Brief 2-3 sentence overview of the applicant's fit for the role.",
        "qualifications": [
            "Qualifier 1",
            "Qualifier 2",
            "Qualifier 3",
            ...
        ],
        "considerations": [
            "Consideration 1",
            "Consideration 2",
            "Consideration 3",
            ...
        ],
        "experience_justification": "Brief explanation for the experience score."
    }}
}}
```
